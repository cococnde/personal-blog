## Description

This is a personal blog website where users can submit their name, title, and content of a blog post. The data is stored in localStorage and the user is redirected to a second page that loads the data from localStorage. The blog page has a dark mode toggle and each blog post is displayed in its own box.

## Installation

To install, download the repository and open `index.html` in your browser. No additional installation is required as this project runs in the browser and uses localStorage for data persistence.

## Usage

To use the blog, fill out the form on the main page with your name, the title of your blog post, and the content of your post. Click submit to save your post and be redirected to the blog page. On the blog page, you can read your post, return to the main page, or toggle dark mode.
